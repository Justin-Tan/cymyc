# CYMYC 

`cymyc` is a library for numerical differential geometry on Calabi-Yau manifolds written in JAX, enabling performant:

* Approximations of useful tensor fields;
* Computations of curvature-related quantities;
* Investigations of the complex structure moduli space;

in addition to many other features. 

If you're completely new to JAX or Python, then start with this [EXAMPLE.](basics.md)

## Installation

Pip package here.
```
pip install cymyc
```
Requires Python 3.10+ and Jax 0.4.20+.
