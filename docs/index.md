# Getting started

`cycmc` is a library for numerical differential geometry on Calabi-Yau manifolds, enabling:

* Approximations of useful tensor fields;
* Computations of curvature-related quantities;
* Investigations of the complex structure moduli space;

in addition to many other features. 

If you're completely new to JAX or Python, then start with this [EXAMPLE.](basics.md)
