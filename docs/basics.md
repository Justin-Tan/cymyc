# The Basics

## Philosophy

The pullback metric $\iota^* g$ may be computed as:

\[
    \iota^* g = J^T g J\,.
\]

### abstract nonsense

```py title="curvature"
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

import numpy as np

def metric_fn(p):
    return 

def christoffel_symbols(p):
    return del_z(p, metric_fn)
```
